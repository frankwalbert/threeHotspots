# basic read stats: FastQC
# run this on the node:

~/src/FastQC/fastqc YOUR_OUTPUT_FOLDER/trimmomatic/*.fastq.gz --outdir=YOUR_OUTPUT_FOLDER/QC

# no obvious problems with the files
# FastQC flags  per-base sequence content: there is non-uniformity in the first ~12 bases. A priming bias of some sort?
# FastQC flags sequence duplication levels: there was a clear peak at some reads >10 copies before deduplication. These could be rRNA, paralogs, or, of course, PCR duplicates. Similar in all samples.


# for RSeQC

# get yeast GTF in BED format from UCSC; file is provided in code folder

# problem with having all files have the same name is that in the plot we cannot tell them apart any more
# since we're only doing thus once, go in manually and give them useable names
# then call from the YOUR_OUTPUT_FOLDER/QC/RSeqQC directory:

geneBody_coverage.py -i `ls -dm ../../*/pseudoalignments*.bam | tr -d ' \n'` -r ensemblGenes_fromUCSC_mod.bed -o RSeQC_geneBodyCoverage

# the samples are extremely similar to each other

# compute these for later use in gene based filtering in R scirpt
tin.py -i `ls -dm ../../*/pseudoalignments*.bam | tr -d ' \n'` -r ensemblGenes_fromUCSC_mod.bed > RSeQC_TIN
